## Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a field of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to "learn" from data, without being explicitly programmed. The primary aim is to allow the computers to learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.

### Key Concepts

- **Supervised Learning**: The algorithm is trained on labeled data.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: The algorithm is used on data without labels.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment to achieve a goal.

### Applications

- Image and speech recognition
- Medical diagnosis
- Predictive analytics
- Autonomous vehicles

Machine Learning is a rapidly evolving field with a wide range of applications in various industries.
