# Fundamentals of Machine Learning

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Data

Data is the foundation of ML. It can be in various forms such as numbers, text, images, etc. The quality and quantity of data significantly impact the performance of ML models.

### 2. Algorithms

Algorithms are the mathematical procedures that ML models use to learn from data. Common algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks.

### 3. Models

A model is the output of an ML algorithm after it has been trained on data. It represents the learned patterns and can be used to make predictions on new data.

### 4. Training

Training is the process of feeding data to an ML algorithm to learn the patterns. This involves adjusting the model parameters to minimize errors.

### 5. Testing

Testing evaluates the performance of the trained model using a separate dataset that was not used during training. This helps to ensure that the model generalizes well to new data.

### 6. Features

Features are the individual measurable properties or characteristics of the data. Selecting the right features is crucial for building effective ML models.

### 7. Labels

Labels are the outcomes or target variables that the model is trying to predict. In supervised learning, the model learns from labeled data.

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning

The model is trained on labeled data, meaning the input data is paired with the correct output. Examples include classification and regression.

### 2. Unsupervised Learning

The model is trained on unlabeled data and must find patterns and relationships within the data. Examples include clustering and dimensionality reduction.

### 3. Reinforcement Learning

The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions. This is commonly used in robotics and game playing.

## Applications of Machine Learning

- Image and speech recognition
- Medical diagnosis
